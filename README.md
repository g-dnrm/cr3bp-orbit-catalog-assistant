# üöÄ CR3BP Orbit Catalog Artifacts Repository

**This repository stores public, auto-generated artifacts (JSON, PNG, CSV) created by the CR3BP Orbit Catalog Assistant.**  
Files are generated by the FastAPI proxy server when users query, filter, plot, or export periodic orbits from NASA's Three-Body Problem catalog.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How These Files Are Produced

- The **CR3BP Orbit Catalog Assistant** runs as a FastAPI proxy on Fly.io.
- When a user generates, plots, or exports orbits, the server:
  1. Queries NASA/JPL‚Äôs CR3BP Periodic Orbits API.
  2. Produces a result bundle, plot, or export.
  3. Uploads the file to this repository‚Äôs `files/` folder via the GitHub Contents API.
- The server then returns a **`raw.githubusercontent.com` URL** to the client (e.g., a GPT integration), allowing direct download without authentication.

## üì¶ File Types

| Extension | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `.json`   | Result bundles from `/orbits/generate` (full filter results) |
| `.png`    | 3D plots from `/plot/single` and `/plot/family` |
| `.csv`    | Orbit initial conditions or propagated trajectories from `/export/trajectory` |

## üîó Example Artifact URL

A public raw URL looks like:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/files/20250811T145501_bundle_ab12cd34.json
```

This link can be opened directly in a browser or used by scripts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- All files here are **public** and permanent unless manually removed.
- Timestamps and short hashes are included in filenames for uniqueness.
- No authentication is required to download files.
